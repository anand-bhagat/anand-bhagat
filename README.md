# 👋 Hi there, I'm Anand Bhagat!

I'm a passionate **full-stack developer** with over **five years of experience** building reliable, scalable, and user-centric web applications. My journey in development has seen me take on both **front-end** and **back-end** challenges, from crafting seamless user experiences to architecting robust server infrastructures.

### 🔭 What I Do

I'm currently a **Senior Delivery Engineer at Adglobal360**, where I lead the frontend development of a Human Resource Management System (HRMS) using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. I enjoy building components that not only solve user problems but also look and feel great. Previously, I've developed cloud applications for healthcare, built real-time blockchain-based social media applications, and contributed to educational platforms.

My key technical skills include:

- **Front-end**: React, Next.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, jQuery
- **Back-end**: Node.js, Laravel, PHP, MySQL, MongoDB, GraphQL
- **Tools**: Git, Figma, Tailwind UI, AWS, Docker
